# DataCleaning_LABikeData

This project was to dive into data cleaning and imputation techniques. In the real world, data is not properly collected for a multitude of reasons -- manual/incomplete responses, poorly constructed surveys, or missing data. As a result, I experience first-hand how it is like dealing with such a data set. 

In this example, I work on the LA Bike Metro data set extracted from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-metro-bike-share-trip-data). There is no competition on this, as this is simply public data for all to fiddle with.

In addition to spending time cleaning data, I also do some exploratory data analysis. I take a look at some interesting features that could be useful for the LA Metro Bike company. Graphs and analyses included in the Jupyter Notebook.
